# Natural Languge Processing and Support Vector Machines

In this project we work with a dataset that contains URLs and if they are associated with SPAM or not.

We will clean the data and process it with NLP techniques to make it ready for modeling. A Support Vector Machine model is trained to classify URLs as SPAM or not SPAM. 

The best model found has an f1 score for SPAM URLs of 67%.
